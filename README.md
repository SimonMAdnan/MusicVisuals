## Instructions

- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
Using music to create bunch of 2d items then they change their color and size depending on the music.
A DVD style bouncing logo where it bounces from side to side chaning size and shape

# Instructions
Run the code it will start up normally.
Press Space to restart

# How it works
It takes a for Loop to display the 2d items radomly across the screen but its colors and size are dependant on the music from the audio buffer.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
That it worked. I Wasn't in for the most part of it but i tried to catch up. Had a lot of difficulties 
trying to start this project from the muic data folder being in the wrong area to where my clases would 
not load up correctly. Or my pc almost over heating and nearly dying beacuse I for looped something that i shouldn't have. My original idea was to have the Toothless Dancing meme and have that for this project but i ran into difficulties trying to create it.
I wouldn't say im proud of this project but i did what i could but if i would do it again then i would do it alot better than this.
